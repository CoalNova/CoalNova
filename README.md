### Hello, and Welcome!
My name is Chris, and I am a self-taught programmer. I have spent several years learning C#, C++, C, Java, and (currently) Zig. I have a fondness for optimized and elegant solutions. 


I am regularly working to expand my knowledge base outward and upward. Currently, I am engaged in a self-prescribed training regimen to learn Kubernetes, Java, SQL, Azure, and AWS. I am also chopping away at Advent of Code in Zig.
